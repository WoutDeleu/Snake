# Snake Game in Java 🐍

This project is a Java implementation of the classic Snake game based on the tutorial provided in the YouTube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ).

### Overview
In this project, we create a simple Snake game in Java. The game provides a grid where the player controls a snake to collect food and grow in size. The game keeps track of the player's score and ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
